## 1. Problem Statement

Crowd crushes (Itaewon 2022, Hillsborough 1989) kill people because dangerous pressure buildup is **invisible** until it is too late. Existing crowd analysis models (CSRNet, MCNN) predict *how many people* are in a frame but ignore the *forces* between them. A high-density static crowd is safe; the same density moving in conflicting directions is lethal.

**Goal:** Predict a spatial pressure map P(x, y, t) that spikes ≥ 5 seconds before a crush becomes visible, giving security staff an actionable lead time.

---

## 2. Core Idea — Why Treat Crowds as Fluid?

At high densities, individual pedestrian decisions become irrelevant — people are physically pushed by the crowd around them. This regime is well-described by **compressible fluid mechanics**. We borrow the **continuity equation** from fluid dynamics:

```
∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρu) = 0
```

Where:
- `ρ(x,y,t)` = crowd density (persons/m²) — estimated by CSRNet
- `u(x,y,t) = (ux, uy)` = crowd velocity field — estimated by RAFT optical flow
- The equation says: density changes where people are flowing in or out

In a crush, this equation **breaks down locally** — density is rising faster than the flow field can explain. The residual `R = ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρu) ≠ 0` is a direct measure of dangerous compression. We use this residual as a physics-informed training loss.

**Pressure proxy:**
```
P(x,y,t) = ρ(x,y,t) · Var(u)
```
High density + high velocity variance = people being squeezed from multiple directions = danger.

**Why this beats pure deep learning:** A model trained only on labeled crush data will overfit to the appearance of panic (running, falling). Our physics loss teaches the model to detect the *forces* that cause panic, which appear earlier and are appearance-agnostic.

## 4. Phase 1 — Perception

### Step 2: Preprocessing & Data Pipeline

**Files:** `preprocessing/frame_extractor.py`, `preprocessing/umn_splitter.py`, `preprocessing/dataset_loader.py`

#### What we built

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `extract_frame_pairs()` | Streams consecutive `(frame_t, frame_t+1)` pairs from video without loading full file into RAM |
| `list_fdst_scenes()` | Discovers all 13 FDST scene directories under `train_data/` or `test_data/` |
| `split_umn()` | Cuts single UMN `.avi` into 3 scene clips at hardcoded boundaries (0–640, 641–1000, 1001–end) |
| `FDSTDataset` | PyTorch Dataset for FDST; builds Gaussian density maps from VIA bounding-box JSON annotations |
| `UMNDataset` | PyTorch Dataset for UMN; bicubic-upsamples 320×240 → 640×480 before returning tensors |
| `ShanghaiTechDataset` | PyTorch Dataset for ShanghaiTech; builds density maps from `.mat` point annotations |
| `SequentialSceneSampler` | Custom sampler that shuffles *scenes* between epochs but keeps frames within each scene in temporal order |

#### Key design decisions

**Why `SequentialSceneSampler` instead of `DataLoader(shuffle=True)`?**
The physics loss `∂ρ/∂t ≈ (ρ_t+1 - ρ_t) / Δt` is only meaningful between two frames from the same continuous video sequence. If we shuffle frame pairs independently, we would compute density differences between frames from entirely different scenes — the physics loss would be trained on nonsense and diverge. The sampler shuffles the order of scenes (for randomisation across epochs) but never breaks temporal order within a scene.

**Why Gaussian-smoothed density maps (σ=15 px)?**
Raw point/box annotations are delta functions — a single pixel with value 1. CNNs cannot learn from delta functions (the gradient signal is spatially too sparse). Gaussian smoothing spreads each head annotation into a small blob. The total integral is preserved (sum ≈ head count), but the spatial structure gives the model a learnable signal at every pixel near a head. σ=15 px is the value used in the original CSRNet paper for the FDST-scale images.

**Why bicubic upsample UMN from 320×240 → 640×480?**
RAFT optical flow quality degrades sharply at very low resolution. At 320×240, fine-grained motion vectors become unreliable. Bicubic upsampling before RAFT gives it enough spatial detail to produce usable flow. This is applied only to UMN — FDST frames are already 1080×1920 HD.

**FDST JSON format — VIA bounding boxes:**
The FDST dataset was annotated with the VGG Image Annotator (VIA) tool. Each `.json` stores bounding boxes around each head as `{"x", "y", "width", "height"}`. We extract the box center `(x + w/2, y + h/2)` as the head point to build the density map, matching the standard crowd counting convention.

#### Bug fix — density map integral not preserved after downsampling (2026-04-23)

`F.interpolate(..., mode="bilinear")` computes a weighted **average** of the source pixels, which reduces the sum by the area ratio (64× for 8× downsampling). A density map encodes a count integral — the sum must equal the head count, not the per-pixel average. Fix applied to both `FDSTDataset` and `ShanghaiTechDataset`:

```python
density_t = F.interpolate(density_t, size=(dh, dw), mode="bilinear", align_corners=False)
density_t = density_t * (h * w) / (dh * dw)   # restore integral
```

#### Verified on Colab (2026-04-23)
- Train pairs: ~8,987 | Test pairs: ~5,987 across 13 scenes
- Batch shape: `frame_t (4, 3, 1080, 1920)`, `density (4, 1, 135, 240)` ✅
- Density map resolution `135×240 = 1080/8 × 1920/8` matches CSRNet output stride ✅
- Zero temporal ordering violations across 500 sampled pairs ✅

---

### Step 3: Branch 1 — CSRNet Density

**File:** `models/branch1_density.py`

#### What we built

`CSRNet` — a PyTorch `nn.Module` that takes `(B, 3, H, W)` RGB frames and outputs a density map `ρ` of shape `(B, 1, H/8, W/8)`.

#### Architecture details

**Why CSRNet?**
CSRNet (Li et al., CVPR 2018) is the established baseline for crowd density estimation. It achieves state-of-the-art MAE on ShanghaiTech and is specifically designed for the task we need: converting a crowd image into a spatial density map whose pixel values sum to the person count. It is also lightweight enough to fit alongside RAFT on a 16 GB T4.

**Why VGG-16 as the frontend?**
Three reasons:
1. **Proven feature extractor for crowds.** The original CSRNet paper uses VGG-16 and achieves the reported SOTA numbers. Using the same backbone lets us compare directly to published results.
2. **Transfer learning.** ImageNet-pretrained VGG-16 weights give the model strong low/mid-level visual features (edges, textures, object parts) from day one. Training from scratch on FDST's ~9,000 frames would severely underfit.
3. **Right output stride.** The first 10 VGG-16 layers (up to pool3) produce a feature map at 1/8 the input resolution — exactly what we need to match with RAFT's downsampled flow output. This resolution is a constraint from the physics loss: both `ρ` and `u` must be on the same spatial grid.

**Why the first 17 VGG-16 layers?**
Layers 0–16 include conv1_1 through pool3 (three max-pool operations → stride 8). We stop here because:
- Further VGG pooling (pool4, pool5) would reduce spatial resolution to 1/32, making the density map too coarse to localise crowd pressure spatially.
- The dilated convolution backend replaces those deeper VGG layers with rate-2 dilations, which grow the receptive field without losing resolution.

**Why dilated convolutions in the backend?**
Standard convolutions with stride > 1 reduce spatial resolution. Dilated (atrous) convolutions increase the receptive field exponentially without downsampling — the filter "skips" pixels by the dilation rate. With rate=2 and a 3×3 kernel, the effective receptive field is 5×5 per layer. Six such layers give a receptive field large enough to see a full person cluster while keeping the output at H/8 resolution. This is the core insight of CSRNet over earlier crowd counting models.

**Why gradient checkpointing on the frontend?**
The VGG frontend is the memory bottleneck. At batch size 4 with 1080×1920 inputs, the intermediate activations of the frontend alone would exceed 16 GB VRAM. Gradient checkpointing trades compute for memory: instead of storing all intermediate activations for the backward pass, it recomputes them on demand. This roughly halves VRAM usage at the cost of ~30% longer backward pass — an acceptable trade-off on Colab T4.

**Weight initialisation:**
- Frontend: copied from `torchvision` ImageNet-pretrained VGG-16
- Backend + head: Kaiming uniform (designed for ReLU networks; prevents vanishing/exploding gradients at init)

#### Output

```
Input:  (B, 3, H,   W)
Output: (B, 1, H/8, W/8)   — density map ρ, values ≥ 0, sum ≈ person count
```

For FDST frames (1080×1920): output is `(B, 1, 135, 240)` — matches the ground-truth density maps built in Step 2.

---

### Step 4: Branch 2 — RAFT Optical Flow

**File:** `models/branch2_flow.py`

#### What we built

`RAFTFlow` — a PyTorch `nn.Module` that takes consecutive frame pairs `(frame_t, frame_t1)` at `(B, 3, H, W)` and outputs a velocity field `u = (ux, uy)` at `(B, 2, H/8, W/8)`.

#### Architecture details

**Why RAFT-Small (not RAFT-Large)?**
RAFT-Large requires ~5× more VRAM. At 1080×1920 inputs on a T4 (16 GB), running Large alongside CSRNet would OOM. RAFT-Small achieves ~1.5 px EPE on Sintel Clean — sufficient for crowd motion where displacements are typically 5–30 px/frame.

**Why frozen weights?**
FDST has no optical-flow ground truth. End-to-end fine-tuning would need `L_motion` from CrowdFlow (a small synthetic set), risking catastrophic forgetting of pretrained flow quality. Freezing produces reliable velocity estimates from day one. `set_trainable(True)` can be called if CrowdFlow GT is used.

**Why downsample flow to H/8?**
The physics loss `∂ρ/∂t + ∇·(ρu)` requires `ρ` and `u` on the same spatial grid. CSRNet outputs `ρ` at H/8 × W/8, so RAFT's full-resolution flow is bilinear-downsampled to match. Flow magnitudes are also scaled by 1/8 to keep units consistent at the coarse grid.

**ImageNet denormalisation:**
RAFT expects pixel values in [0, 255]. Our pipeline normalises frames to ImageNet mean/std, so the wrapper undoes this before calling RAFT and re-applies inside the forward pass transparently.

**`num_flow_updates = 12`:**
RAFT uses a recurrent GRU to iteratively refine the flow estimate. 12 iterations is the RAFT paper default for RAFT-Small. Fewer iterations trade accuracy for speed (useful for inference-time ablations).

#### Output

```
Input:  frame_t, frame_t1  — (B, 3, H, W)  ImageNet-normalised RGB
Output: u                  — (B, 2, H/8, W/8)  (ux, uy) in pixels/frame at coarse grid
```

For FDST frames (1080×1920): output is `(B, 2, 135, 240)` — matches the CSRNet density map grid for the physics loss.

---

### Step 5: Smoke Test — End-to-End Branch 1 + 2

**File:** `smoke_test.py`

#### What it checks

| Check | What failure would mean |
|---|---|
| FDSTDataset shapes + density sum | Dataset loader or annotation parsing broken |
| CSRNet output `(1, 1, H/8, W/8)` | Frontend stride or backend depth wrong |
| RAFTFlow output `(1, 2, H/8, W/8)` | Padding logic, RAFT import, or downsample broken |
| `rho.isfinite()` | NaN/Inf from uninitialised weights or bad forward pass |
| `u.isfinite()` | RAFT diverged on extreme inputs |
| `rho.shape[-2:] == u.shape[-2:]` | Grids misaligned — physics loss would be meaningless |

#### Usage

```bash
python smoke_test.py                              # CPU, synthetic 272x480 frames
python smoke_test.py --device cuda               # GPU, synthetic frames
python smoke_test.py --fdst data/fdst --device cuda  # real FDST frames
```

Falls back to synthetic random tensors automatically if FDST path is not provided or unavailable, so it can run in any environment.

## 5. Phase 2 — Physics

### Step 6: Continuity Loss

**File:** `losses/continuity_loss.py`

#### What we built

`continuity_loss(rho_t, rho_t1, u, fps)` — computes the squared continuity residual:

```
R = ∂ρ/∂t + ∂(ρ·ux)/∂x + ∂(ρ·uy)/∂y
L_physics = mean(R²)
```

`ContinuityLoss` — `nn.Module` wrapper for use in the training loop.

#### Boundary handling: options considered

Computing spatial derivatives `∂(ρu)/∂x` and `∂(ρu)/∂y` requires a choice at image boundaries where one-sided neighbors don't exist. Three options were evaluated:

**Option A — Interior only (no padding, discard boundary pixels)**
- Compute central differences without padding; output is `(H-2) × (W-2)`.
- Pro: Every computed value is mathematically exact (O(h²) error).
- Con: Systematically discards the 1-pixel border from the physics loss. Crowd crushes often happen at barriers and walls, which appear at frame edges — this would create a blind spot exactly where pressure is most dangerous.

**Option B — Replicate padding**
- Pad the border by replicating the edge pixel, then apply central differences everywhere; output is full `H × W`.
- Pro: Full spatial coverage.
- Con: At the boundary, the padded neighbor equals the edge value, so the central difference gives `(x[1] - x[0]) / 2` instead of the correct derivative. For a linear function this underestimates the derivative by 50%. The physics loss is **silently wrong at boundaries** — the worst kind of error.

**Option C — Mixed one-sided / central differences ✅ (chosen)**
- Forward difference at left/top edge, backward difference at right/bottom edge, central difference in the interior. Output is full `H × W`.
- Pro: Exact everywhere. Interior pixels have O(h²) error (central); boundary pixels have O(h) error (one-sided), which is acceptable at our spatial scales.
- Con: Slightly more code than Options A or B.

#### Why Option C

Option B is ruled out — a systematic 50% gradient underestimate at boundaries is worse than no boundary coverage at all. Between A and C, Option C is clearly better for this problem: crowd pressure builds up against physical barriers (walls, fences, stage barriers), which appear at the edges of fixed-camera footage. Option A's blind spot is exactly the wrong place to have one.

#### Implementation

```python
def _diff_x(x):
    out = torch.empty_like(x)
    out[:, :, :,  0]   = x[:, :, :,  1] - x[:, :, :,  0]         # forward
    out[:, :, :, -1]   = x[:, :, :, -1] - x[:, :, :, -2]         # backward
    out[:, :, :, 1:-1] = (x[:, :, :, 2:] - x[:, :, :, :-2]) / 2.0
    return out
```

The same pattern applies to `_diff_y` along rows.

#### Design decisions

| Decision | Alternative | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Use `rho_t` (not average of `rho_t`, `rho_t1`) for divergence term | Average of both frames | `rho_t` is the density at the spatial snapshot we're differentiating; averaging would mix two time steps into a single spatial derivative, muddling the temporal/spatial separation |
| Forward difference for `∂ρ/∂t` | Backward, central | The pair `(rho_t, rho_t1)` is a forward step; forward difference is the natural choice and avoids needing `rho_{t-1}` |
| `mean(R²)` not `sum(R²)` | Sum | Mean is independent of spatial resolution — if we change the density map scale the loss magnitude stays comparable |

---

### Step 7: Branch 3 — Pressure Map + Total Loss

**Files:** `models/branch3_pressure.py`, `losses/total_loss.py`

#### What we built

`PressureMap` — an `nn.Module` that takes `ρ (B, 1, H, W)` and `u (B, 2, H, W)` and returns a pressure map `P (B, 1, H, W)`:

```
P(x, y, t) = ρ(x, y, t) · Var_local(u)
```

where `Var_local(u)` is the average of the per-channel local variances of `ux` and `uy` over a 5×5 sliding window:

```
Var_local(u) = (Var_window(ux) + Var_window(uy)) / 2
Var_window(f) = E[f²] - E[f]²    (computed via avg_pool2d)
```

`TotalLoss` — an `nn.Module` that combines all three loss terms:

```
L_total = L_count + λ1·L_motion + λ2·‖R‖²
```

- `L_count` = MSE(predicted density sum per image, GT head count)
- `L_motion` = EPE (endpoint error) against GT flow when available, else 0
- `‖R‖²` = continuity residual from `ContinuityLoss`
- Returns a dict `{total, count, motion, physics}` for logging each term individually

#### Pressure map design

**Why `ρ · Var(u)`?**
A dense, slowly moving crowd (stadium standing area) has high `ρ` but low `Var(u)` — people all move the same direction. Pressure is low. A crush scenario has high `ρ` and high `Var(u)` — people are being pushed from multiple directions simultaneously. The product captures this interaction. Velocity magnitude alone is insufficient: a fast but uniform flow (e.g., an orderly evacuation) is not dangerous.

**Why local variance over a 5×5 window?**
Per-pixel variance would be zero for any smooth flow field — variance is a population statistic. A local window (5×5 at H/8 resolution ≈ 40×40 pixels at full resolution) captures the spatial spread of velocity within a human-scale neighbourhood. The window size is a hyperparameter; 5×5 was chosen as the smallest window that reliably captures multi-directional crowd motion in dense sequences.

**Boundary handling — zero-padding (deliberate choice):**
`avg_pool2d` uses zero-padding by default, which means border pixels see a mix of real values and artificial zeros in their local window. This inflates the apparent variance at image boundaries. We considered replicate padding (which would give zero variance for spatially uniform flow all the way to the border), but rejected it for two reasons:
1. The border artifact from zero-padding is physically harmless — it will produce slightly elevated pressure near frame edges, which is conservative (safer to over-alert than to miss).
2. Zero-padding is the simpler, more standard implementation. Replicate padding requires a manual pre-pad step and was introduced only to satisfy a test invariant that isn't physically required.

The test `test_zero_pressure_uniform_flow` checks interior pixels only (cropped by `window_size // 2`), which is where the physical invariant actually holds.

**Why `L_count` uses the density sum (not pixel-wise MSE)?**
Our ground truth is a *count* per image, not a per-pixel density map for every training frame. ShanghaiTech provides density maps, but FDST annotations are head bounding boxes from which we construct Gaussian maps ourselves. Using the sum preserves the count constraint without assuming our Gaussian-smoothed maps are ground truth at every pixel. Pixel-wise MSE against self-constructed density maps would overfit to our σ=15 px choice.

**Why `L_motion` is 0 when no GT flow is provided?**
FDST has no optical flow ground truth. Setting `L_motion = 0` in that case is correct: the EPE term should only appear when we have reliable flow labels (CrowdFlow). Passing `gt_flow=None` to `TotalLoss.forward()` signals this cleanly without a separate flag.

#### Output

```
TotalLoss.forward(rho_t, rho_t1, u, gt_count, gt_flow=None)
→ {
    'total':   scalar  — backprop target
    'count':   scalar  — L_count alone
    'motion':  scalar  — L_motion alone (0 if no gt_flow)
    'physics': scalar  — ‖R‖² alone
  }
```

---

### Step 8: Full PINN Model

**File:** `models/pinn.py`

#### What we built

`FluidFlowPINN` — a single `nn.Module` that wires all three branches together:

```python
out = model(frame_t, frame_t1)
# out = {'rho': (B,1,H/8,W/8), 'rho_t1': (B,1,H/8,W/8), 'u': (B,2,H/8,W/8), 'P': (B,1,H/8,W/8)}
```

#### Architecture wiring

```
frame_t  ──► CSRNet ──► rho_t  ──┐
                                  ├──► PressureMap ──► P
frame_t1 ──► CSRNet ──► rho_t1   │
                                  │ (rho_t1 passed to TotalLoss for ∂ρ/∂t)
frame_t  ──┐
           ├──► RAFTFlow ──► u ──┘
frame_t1 ──┘
```

CSRNet runs twice per forward pass — once for `frame_t`, once for `frame_t1`. This is necessary because both density maps are needed: `rho_t` enters the pressure map and the continuity divergence term, while `rho_t1` enters the temporal derivative `∂ρ/∂t`. Sharing weights between the two calls is correct (it is the same model applied at different time steps) and costs zero extra parameters.

#### Memory design

Two VRAM-saving mechanisms are active by default:

| Mechanism | What it does | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Gradient checkpointing | Recomputes VGG frontend activations on backward instead of storing them | `CSRNet(use_grad_checkpoint=True)` |
| RAFT frozen | RAFT weights have `requires_grad=False`; no gradient storage for flow branch | `RAFTFlow(frozen=True)` |

FP16 is **not** managed inside `FluidFlowPINN`. It is applied externally via `torch.cuda.amp.autocast()` in the training loop. This is the standard PyTorch AMP pattern — the model itself stays in FP32 and AMP selectively casts operations.

**Why not freeze CSRNet too?**
CSRNet needs to be fine-tuned on FDST to produce accurate density maps for our specific dataset and camera angles. The pretrained VGG-16 weights in the frontend give a warm start, but the dilated backend and density head are randomly initialised and must be trained. RAFT is frozen because it already produces high-quality flow vectors without fine-tuning, and FDST has no flow ground truth to fine-tune against.

#### Output contract

```
{'rho':    (B, 1, H/8, W/8)   density map at t
 'rho_t1': (B, 1, H/8, W/8)  density map at t+1
 'u':      (B, 2, H/8, W/8)  flow field (ux, uy)
 'P':      (B, 1, H/8, W/8)  pressure map}
```

`rho_t1` is included in the output so the training loop can pass it directly to `TotalLoss` without re-running CSRNet.

## 7. Design Decisions Log

| Decision | Alternative considered | Why we chose this |
|---|---|---|
| CSRNet for density | MCNN, DM-Count, BayesCrowd | CSRNet is the reference model in the crowd crushing literature; lightest that still achieves SOTA MAE |
| VGG-16 frontend | ResNet-50, MobileNet | CSRNet paper uses VGG-16; changing backbone would invalidate pretrained CSRNet weight compatibility |
| RAFT for optical flow | Farneback (classical), FlowNet | RAFT is current SOTA learned flow; far more accurate on crowd motion than classical methods |
| RAFT-Small (not Large) | RAFT-Large | RAFT-Large would OOM on T4 alongside CSRNet at 1080×1920; Small is accurate enough for crowd motion (~5–30 px/frame displacements) |
| RAFT frozen by default | End-to-end fine-tuning | FDST has no flow GT; freezing avoids catastrophic forgetting; `set_trainable(True)` unlocks fine-tuning on CrowdFlow |
| Flow scaled by 1/8 after downsample | Keep raw pixel values | Downsampled flow represents motion at the coarse grid — dividing by 8 keeps units consistent with the density-grid pixel spacing |
| Continuity equation as physics loss | Momentum equation, energy equation | Continuity only requires `ρ` and `u` — no pressure terms needed as input, making it self-contained |
| σ=15 px Gaussian smoothing | Adaptive σ (geometry-aware), σ=4 | σ=15 is the CSRNet paper value for similar-scale datasets; geometry-aware requires camera calibration we don't have |
| 1/8 density resolution | 1/4, full resolution | 1/8 is the natural VGG-16 frontend output stride; going finer requires extra upsampling that adds noise |
| λ2=0.01 for physics loss | 0.1, 0.001 | Too high → physics loss dominates and density accuracy collapses; too low → physics constraint ignored |
| Batch size 4 | 8, 16 | T4 has 16 GB VRAM; at 1080×1920 inputs with FP16 + grad checkpoint, batch 4 is the safe maximum |
| Mixed one-sided/central differences for spatial derivatives | Replicate padding (Option B), interior only (Option A) | Option B silently underestimates boundary gradients by 50%; Option A creates a blind spot at frame edges where crowd pressure against barriers is most dangerous; Option C is exact everywhere |
| `mean(R²)` as physics loss scalar | `sum(R²)` | Mean is resolution-independent — loss magnitude stays comparable if density map scale changes |
| `P = ρ · Var(u)` for pressure | `P = ρ · ‖u‖`, raw pressure via Navier-Stokes | Velocity magnitude misses directional conflict (orderly fast evacuation ≠ crush); `Var(u)` captures multi-directional compression; full NS pressure requires solving a Poisson equation |
| 5×5 local window for `Var(u)` | 3×3, 7×7, per-pixel | Per-pixel variance is always zero; 3×3 too small to capture crowd-scale motion spread; 5×5 ≈ 40×40 px at full resolution matches human body width at typical crowd densities |
| Zero-padding in `avg_pool2d` for pressure | Replicate padding | Zero-padding is standard; the border artifact is conservative (over-estimates pressure at edges, which is safer than under-estimating); replicate padding adds code without a physical justification |
| `L_count` = MSE(sum(ρ), GT count) | Pixel-wise MSE against density map | GT is a head count, not a validated per-pixel density map; count-loss avoids overfitting to our σ=15 Gaussian construction |
| `L_motion = 0` when no GT flow | Dummy EPE against zero flow | Penalising u against zero would force RAFT outputs toward zero — a regression toward no motion, which directly breaks the physics loss |
| CSRNet run twice per forward (frame_t and frame_t1) | Run once, reuse rho_t as rho_t1 | Both time steps are needed for `∂ρ/∂t`; weight sharing is free (same model, different inputs); reusing rho_t would make the temporal derivative always zero |
| FP16 via external `autocast()`, not inside model | Cast tensors inside `forward()` | Standard PyTorch AMP pattern; keeps model portable and lets the training loop control precision scope |

## 8. Open Questions

- [ ] Will the continuity residual `R` be meaningful at 1/8 resolution, or does downsampling smooth out the local compression signal?
- [ ] UMN is 30fps at 320×240 — after bicubic upsample to 640×480, will RAFT produce usable flow vectors or will the upsampled frames introduce artifacts?
- [ ] Should `λ1` and `λ2` be fixed or scheduled (e.g., ramp up physics loss weight as training progresses)?
- [x] The pressure proxy `P = ρ · Var(u)` uses a 5×5 local window — is this window size physically motivated or empirical? → Empirical. 5×5 at H/8 resolution ≈ 40×40 px at full resolution, roughly matching human body width at typical crowd densities. Physically motivated would require calibrated pixel-to-metre mapping (Venice dataset). Window size is exposed as a hyperparameter in `PressureMap(window_size=...)` and `configs/default.yaml`.
- [ ] Does the pressure map `P` need to be normalised before thresholding for the UMN lead-time evaluation, or can a fixed threshold be applied across scenes?
- [ ] The full PINN model runs CSRNet twice per forward pass (frame_t and frame_t1). At batch size 4 on T4 with FP16, does this double the activation memory footprint of the density branch, or does gradient checkpointing contain it?
- [ ] ShanghaiTech Part A has images up to 3139 persons — will the Gaussian density maps with σ=15 px overlap too heavily at that density, creating a uniform blob instead of a meaningful map?
